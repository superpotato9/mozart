on a platform im gonna stand and say
that im nothing on my own
and i love you please come home
my song is love is love unknown
and ive got to get that message home in the darkness before the dawn
in the swirling of this storm
when im rolling with the punches and hope is gone
leave a light a light on
millions of miles from home
in the swirling swimming on
when im rolling with the thunder but bleed from thorns
leave a light a light on in the darkness before the dawn
in the darkness before the dawn
oh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh
once upon a time somebody ran
somebody ran away saying fast as i can
i got to go
once upon a time we fell apart
youre holding in your hands the two halves of my heart
ohoh ohohoh
once upon a time we burned bright oh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh
once upon a time we burned bright
now all we ever seem to do is fight
on and on
and on and on and on
once upon a time on the same side
once upon a time on the same side in the same game
now whyd you have to go
have to go and throw water on my flame
i could have been a princess youd be a king
couldve had a castle and worn a ring
but no you let me go
you stole my star
la la la la la la la la
la la la la
cause you really hurt me
no you really hurt me
oh you really hurt me
i tried my best to be just like
the other boys in school
i tried my best to get it right
and died at every duel
this mountainside is suicide
this dream will never work
still the sign upon my headstone write
a champion of the world
i tried my best to stay alight
fly like a firework
i tried my best at taking flight i tried my best to be just like
i tried my best at taking flight
but my rocketship reversed
oh referee dont stop the fight
everyone can see im hurt
but ill stand before conquistadors
til im champion of the world
and when i sail
im sailing west
though i might fail knowing i might fail
but still i am hoping for the best
and in my dreams
onto my chest
shell pin the colours and say
i wandered the whole wide world but
baby youre the best
so im flying on my bicycle
heading upwards from the earth
i am jumping with no parachute
out into the universe
i have et on my bicycle
because giving up wont work
i am riding on my rocketship
and im champion of the world
oh they say people come
say people go
this particular diamond was extra special
and though you might be gone
and the world may not know
still i see you celestial
like a lion you ran
a goddess you rolled
like an eagle you circle
in perfect purple
so how come things move on
how come cars dont slow oh they say people come
how come cars dont slow
when it feels like the end of my world
when i should but i cant let you go
but when im cold cold
oh when im cold cold
theres a light that you give me
when im in shadow
theres a feeling you give me an everglow
like brothers in blood
sisters who ride
and we swore on that night
wed be friends til we die
but the changing of winds
and the way waters flow
life is short as the falling of snow
and now im gonna miss you i know
in water rolled salt
i know that youre always with me
and the way you will show
and youre with me wherever i go
and you give me this feeling
this everglow
oh what i would give for just a moment to hold
yeah i live for this feeling its everglow
so if you love someone
you should let them know
oh the light that you left me will everglow
i think of you
i havent slept
i think i do
but i dont forget
my body moves
goes where i will
but though i try my heart stays still
it never moves
just wont be led
and so my mouth waters to be fed
and youre always in my head
youre always in my head
youre always in my head i think of you
always in my head
always in my
this i guess
is to tell you youre chosen out from the rest
was a long and dark december
from the rooftops i remember
there was snow
white snow
clearly i remember
from the windows they were watching
while we froze down below
when the futures architectured
by a carnival of idiots on show
youd better lie low
if you love me
wont you let me know was a long and dark december
wont you let me know
when the banks became cathedrals
and the fog
became god
priests clutched onto bibles
hollowed out to fit their rifles
and the cross was held aloft
bury me in armor
when im dead and hit the ground
my nerves are poles that unfroze
and if you love me
i dont want to be a soldier
who the captain of some sinking ship
would stow
far below
so if you love me
whyd you let me go
i took my love down to violet hill
there we sat in snow
all that time she was silent still
i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemys eyes
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead long live the king
one minute i held the key i used to rule the world
one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells a ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i cant explain
once you go there was never
never an honest word
and that was when i ruled the world
it was the wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldnt believe what id become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh who would ever want to be king
i know saint peter wont call my name
but that was when i ruled the world
i could be you you could be me
two raindrops in the same sea
you could be me i could be you
two angles of the same view
and we share the same blood
i could be you i could be you you could be me
yeah we share the same blood
music is the weapon music is the weapon of the future
same fucking blood
when you try your best but you dont succeed
when you get what you want but not what you need
when you feel so tired but you cant sleep
stuck in reverse
and the tears come streaming down your face
when you lose something you cant replace
when you love someone but it goes to waste
could it be worse when you try your best but you dont succeed
could it be worse
lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you
and high up above or down below
when youre too in love to let it go
but if you never try youll never know
just what youre worth
tears stream down your face
when you lose something you cannot replace
tears stream down your face and i
i promise you i will learn from my mistakes
stole a key
took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
took a car downtown and took what they offered me
to set me free
i saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
saw the lights go down and standing in front of me
oohoohooh
in my scarecrow dreams
when they smash my heart into smithereens ooh oohoohooh
when they smash my heart into smithereens
be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
be a cartoon heart
light a fire a fire a spark
light a fire a flame in my heart
well run wild
well be glowing in the dark oohoohooh
well be glowing in the dark oohoohooh ah

all that matters in the world
all the madness that occurs

you came to rain a flood

coloratura
we fell in through the clouds
and everyone before us is there welcoming us now
its the end of death and doubt
and loneliness is out
the place we dreamed about
the melodies inside yourself
and love come pouring out
and everyones allowed
were feathered by the crowd
and up there in the heavens coloratura
and up there in the heavens
galileo and those pining for the moon
know its a slow burn
through pioneer and helix
oumamama heliopause and neptune
were a slow burning tune
but well get there
so for now
in this crazy world i do
i just want you
in the end its all about
the love youre sending out
the explorers whove all gathered by balloon
saw the world turn
through voyager callisto calliope
betelgeuse the neon moons
but well touch down soon
so will you
and in this crazy world i do
galileo saw reflections of us too
pluribus unum unus mundus
and all the satellites imbue
the purple yellow green red orange and the blue
oh its a crazy world its true
sing it out
ohohohoh ohohohoh
i just want
in this crazy world its true
poets prophesy up in the blue
together thats how well make it through
how long before i get in
before it starts before i begin
how long before you decide
before i know what it feels like
where to where do i go
if you never try then youll never know
how long do i have to climb
up on the side of this mountain of mine
look up i look up at night how long before i get in
look up i look up at night
planets are moving at the speed of light
climb up up in the trees
every chance that you get
is a chance you seize
how long am i gonna stand
with my head stuck under the sand
ill start before i can stop
before i see things the right way up
all that noise and all that sound
all those places i got found
and birds go flying at the speed of sound
to show you how it all began
birds came flying from the underground
if you could see it then youd understand
ideas that youll never find
all the inventors could never design
the buildings that you put up
japan and china all lit up
the sign that i couldnt read
or a light that i couldnt see
some things you have to believe
but others are puzzles puzzling me
ah when you see it then youll understand
all those signs i knew what they meant
some things you can invent
and some get made and some get sent
ooh
birds go flying at the speed of sound
ah when you see it then youll understand oh no i see
a spider web is tangled up with me
and i lost my head
and thought of all the stupid things id said
oh no whats this
a spider web and im caught in the middle
so i turned to run
the thought of all the stupid things ive done
and i i never meant to cause you trouble oh no i see
and i i never meant to cause you trouble
and i i never meant to do you wrong
and i well if i ever caused you trouble
oh no i never meant to do you harm
oh no i see
a spider web and its me in the middle
so i twist and turn
here am i in my little bubble
singing out i never meant to cause you trouble
they spun a web for me
aside from all the medicine and health
if you could do it all again would you do it all the same
is there something that youd tell your former self
there were those that wished theyd spun upon a jukebox
there were pirates who had never seen the sea talk among the skeletons this morning
there were pirates who had never seen the sea
but the one recurring theme the one recurring dream they had
was to be whatever they wanted to be
to be pyotr tchaikovsky
to be free like everyone else
there will be no flags to warn me no
cause i just wanna be myself
you may telephone in by a ouija
is there any advice that you could give
when you know youre not like them do you know la varsovienne
i know that i am living but can you show me how to live
and the holy roman army
said your heart beats like everyone else
and you dont need no flags to tell you who you are so say
i just wanna be myself
oohlalalala lalalala lalalala
oohlalalala lalalala

theres a different kind of wealth
and i dont need flags to know youre really something
and i just love you for yourself

oh yes i do
of course i do i turn the music up
i got my records on
i shut the world outside until the lights come on
maybe the streets alight
maybe the trees are gone
i feel my heart start beatin to my favorite song

until monday mornin feels another life
i turn the music up i turn the music up

maybe im in the gap between the two trapezes
but my heart is beating and my pulses start
cathedrals in my heart

he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said thats a lie
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin stuck
on backroads at night
and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
september saw a month of tears
and thankin god that you werent here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back
its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
and lookin back on all of that its nice to believe
and im back for the first time since then
im standin on your street
and theres a letter left on your doorstep
and the first thing that youll read is
someday youll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
oh think of me
mmmm
he said the way my blue eyes shine
state the obvious i didnt get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that im obsessive and crazy
thats fine ill tell mine that youre gay
by the way
i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
youre a redneck heartbreak
whos really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned youre
just another picture to burn
theres no time for tears
im just sitting here planning my revenge
theres nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be
and if youre missing me
youd better keep it to yourself
cause coming back around here
would be bad for your health
cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck
in case you havent heard
i really really hate that
burn burn burn baby burn
youre just another picture to burn
baby burn
drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he wont see
that i want and im needing
everything that we should be
ill bet shes beautiful that girl he talks about
and shes got everything that i have to live without
drew talks to me
i laugh cause its so damn funny
that i cant even see
anyone when hes with me
he says hes so in love hes finally got it right
i wonder if he knows hes all i think about at night
hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
hes the song in the car
i keep singing dont know why i do
drew walks by me
cant he tell that i cant breathe
and there he goes so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be
shed better hold him tight give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
so i drive home alone as i turn off the light
ill put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
the only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
hes the time taken up but theres never enough
and hes all that i need to fall into
i dont know what i want so dont ask me
cause im still trying to figure it out
dont know whats down this road im just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though im not the only one
who feels the way i do
im alone on my own and thats all i know
ill be strong ill be wrong oh but life goes on
oh im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
got the radio on my old blue jeans
and im wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today got the sunshine
could you tell me what more do i need
and tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah
but thats ok
maybe im just a girl on a mission
but im ready to fly
oh im alone on my own and thats all i know
oh im just a girl
oh im just a girl oh oh
you have a way of coming easily to me
and when you take you take the very best of me
so i start a fight cause i need to feel something
and you do what you want cause im not what you wanted
oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
just walk away no use defending words that you will never say
and now that im sitting here thinking it through
ive never been anywhere cold as you
you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
and i stood there loving you and wished them all away
and you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
you never did give a damn thing honey but i cried cried for you
and i know you wouldnt have told nobody if i died died for you
died for you
every smile you fake is so condescending
counting all the scars you made
i didnt know what i would find
when i went looking for a reason i know
i didnt read between the lines
and baby ive got nowhere to go
i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right
so how can i ever try to be better
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you this aint the best view
on the outside looking in
ive been a lot of lonely places
ive never been on the outside
you saw me there but never knew
i would give it all up to be
a part of this a part of you
and now its all too late so you see
you couldve helped if you had wanted to
but no one notices until its too
late to do anything
seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking youre not pretty
but thats not true cause i know you
hold on
baby youre losing it
the waters high
youre jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry
but you dont tell anyone
that you might
not be the golden one
and youre tied together with a smile
but youre coming undone
i guess its true that love was all you wanted
cause youre giving it away like its extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh cause its not his price to pay
not his price to pay
youre tied together with a smile
but youre coming undone oh
goodbye baby
with a smile baby baby
corys eyes are like a jungle
he smiles its like the radio
he whispers songs into my window
in words that nobody knows
these pretty girls on every corner
they watch him as hes walking home
saying does he know
will you ever know
youre beautiful
every little piece love
and dont you know
youre really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life will lead you back to my door
oh but if it dont
stay beautiful
cory finds another way to be
the highlight of my day
im taking pictures in my mind
so i can save them for a rainy day
its hard to make a conversation
when hes taking my breath away
i should say hey by the way
if you and i are a story
that never gets told
if what you are is a daydream
ill never get to hold
at least youll know
i hope your life will lead you back to my front door
will you stay
beautiful beautiful beautiful
la la la
oh oh oh oh
na na na na na
its strange to think the songs we used to sing
the smiles the flowers everything is gone
yesterday i found out about you
even now just looking at you feels wrong
you say that youd take it all back given one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said yes
you shouldve said no you shouldve gone home
you shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
you shouldve know that word bout what you did with her
get back to me get back to me
and i shouldve been there in the back of your mind
i shouldnt be asking myself why
you shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you shouldve said no baby and you might still have me
you can see that ive been crying
baby you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same
you say that the past is the past you need one chance
i cant resist
before you go tell me this
was it worth it
was she worth this
no no no no
she said i was seven and you were nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said youd beat me up you were bigger than me
you never did you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids you and i
oh my my my my
well i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasnt that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
they never believed wed really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my
take me back to the creek beds we turned up
two am riding in your truck and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside till the morning light
a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town
and you looked at me got down on one knee
take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said i do and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
well rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time you and i
ill be eightyseven
ill still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky oh my my my
i was riding shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
hes got a onehand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around turn the radio down
he says baby is something wrong
i say nothing i was just thinking
how we dont have a song
and he says
our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin out late tapping on your window
when were on the phone and you talk real slow
cause its late and your mama dont know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date man i didnt kiss her and i should have
and when i got home fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
i was walking up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong and been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway well on my way
to my lovin bed
i almost didnt notice all the roses
and the note that said
ive heard every album listened to the radio
waited for something to come along
that was as good as our song
cause our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin out late tapping on his window
when were on the phone and he talks real slow
cause its late and his mama dont know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date man i didnt kiss him and i should have
play it again
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song
friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes we dont say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side
and i know everything about you
i dont wanna live without you
im only up when youre not down
dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
its like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half im only trying to let you know that what i feel is true
and im only me when im with you
just a small town boy and girl
living in a crazy world
trying to figure out what is and isnt true
and i dont try to hide my tears
the secrets or my deepest fears
through it all nobody gets me like you do
and you know everything about me
you say that you cant live without me
when im with anybody else its so hard to be myself
only you can tell
that im only up when youre not down
and im only me
who i wanna be
well im only me when im with you
with you
uh huh
yeah
she cant see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
shell never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by
and you cant see me wanting you the way you want her
but you are everything to me
i just want to show you
she dont even know you
shes never going to love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle
unbelievable
instead of just invisible
theres a fire inside of you
that cant help but shine through
shes never going to see the light
no matter what you do
and all i think about is how to make you think of me
and everything that we could be
like shadows in a faded light
oh were invisible
i just want to open your eyes
and make you realize
baby let me love you
let me want you
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make the very first scar
maybe i shouldve seen the signs shouldve read the writing on the wall
and realized by the distance in your eyes that i would be the one to fall
no matter what you say i still cant believe
that you would walk away
it dont make sense to me but
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apartnow
its not unbroken anymore
how do i get it back the way it was before
theres something bout the way
the street looks when its just rained
theres a glow off the pavement
you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot yeah
oh yeah
were driving down the road
i wonder if you know
im trying so hard not to get caught up now
but youre just so cool
run your hands through your hair
absent mindedly making me want you
and i dont know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i dont know why but with you id dance in a storm in my best dress
so baby drive slow
til we run out of road in this one horse town
i wanna stay right here in this passengers seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now capture it remember it
well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake im not usually this way but
you pull me in and im a little more brave
its the first kiss its flawless really something
its fearless
oh oh
you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
its the morning of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
try and stay out of everybodys way
its your freshman year and youre going to be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
you know i havent seen you around before
because when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
youre going to believe them
and when youre fifteen feeling like theres nothing to figure out
well count to ten take it in
this is life before you know who youre going to be
fifteen
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough youre best friends
laughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool
well be outta here as soon as we can
and then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
and youre feeling like flying
and your mommas waiting up and youre thinking hes the one
and youre dancing round your room when the night ends
when the night ends
when youre fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin round
but in your life youll do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i didnt know it at fifteen
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then i swore i was going to marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had to a boy
who changed his mind and we both cried
and when youre fifteen dont forget to look before you fall
ive found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who youre supposed to be
i didnt know who i was supposed to be at fifteen
la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la
your very first day
take a deep breath girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts
im standing there
on a balcony in summer air
see the lights see the party the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say hello
little did i know
that you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you please dont go and i said
romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
youll be the prince and ill be the princess
its a love story baby just say yes
so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while
cause you were romeo i was a scarlet letter
but you were everything to me
i was begging you please dont go and i said
romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult but its real
dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said
romeo save me ive been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head i dont know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
and said marry me juliet
youll never have to be alone
i love you and thats all i really know
i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
because we were both young when i first saw you
hey stephen i know looks can be deceiving
but i know i saw a light in you
and as we walked we were talking
i didnt say half the things i wanted to
of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
hey stephen boy you might have me believing
i dont always have to be alone
cause i cant help it if you look like an angel
cant help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic ive been feeling since i met you
cant help it if theres no one else
mmm i cant help myself
hey stephen ive been holding back this feeling
so i got some things to say to you
ive seen it all so i thought
but i never seen nobody shine the way you do
the way you walk way you talk way you say my name
its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change
hey stephen why are people always leaving
i think you and i should stay the same
theyre dimming the street lights youre perfect for me
why arent you here tonight
im waiting alone now so come on and come out
and pull me near and shine shine shine
hey stephen i could give you fifty reasons
why i should be the one you choose
all those other girls well theyre beautiful
but would they write a song for you
myself
cant help myself
i cant help myself
say youre sorry that face of an angel
comes out just when you need it to
as i paced back and forth all this time
cause i honestly believed in you
holdin on the days drag on
stupid girl i shoulda known i shoulda known
that im not a princess this aint a fairytale
im not the one youll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
this aint hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now its too late for you and your white horse
to come around
baby i was naive got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
my mistake i didnt know to be in love
you had to fight to have the upper hand
i had so many dreams about you and me
happy endings now i know
and there you are on your knees
beggin for forgiveness beggin for me
just like i always wanted
but im so sorry
cause im not your princess this aint our fairytale
im gonna find someone someday
who might actually treat me well
this is a big world that was a small town
there in my rear view mirror disappearing now
and its too late for you and your white horse
to catch me now
oh whoa whoa whoa
try and catch me now oh
its too late to catch me now
youre on the phone with your girlfriend shes upset
shes going off about something that you said
cause she doesnt get your humor like i do
im in the room its a typical tuesday night
im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
and shell never know your story like i do
but she wears short skirts i wear tshirts
shes cheer captain and im on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what youre looking for has been here the whole time
if you could see that im the one who understands you
been here all along so why cant you see
you belong with me you belong with me
walking the streets with you and your wornout jeans
i cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
hey isnt this easy
and youve got a smile that could light up this whole town
i havent seen it in a while since she brought you down
you say youre fine i know you better than that
hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
she wears high heels i wear sneakers
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time how could you not know baby
oh i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night
im the one who makes you laugh
when you know youre bout to cry
and i know your favorite songs
and you tell me bout your dreams
think i know where you belong
think i know its with me
cant you see that im the one who understands you
have you ever thought just maybe
i see your face in my mind as i drive away
cause none of us thought it was
going to end that way
people are people
and sometimes we change our minds
but its killing me to see you go after all this time
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
its the kind of ending you
dont really want to see
cause its tragedy and itll only bring you
down
now i dont know what to be without you around
and we know its never simple never easy
never a clean break no one here to
save me
youre the only thing i know like the back of my hand
and i cant
breathe
without you but i have to breathe
without you but i have to
never wanted this never want to see you hurt
every little bump in the road i tried to swerve
but people are people
and sometimes it doesnt work out
nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
its am
feeling like i just lost a friend
hope you know its not easy
easy for me
hope you know this aint easy
sorry sorry
sorry yeah eh sorry
sorry
i took a chance
i took a shot
and you might think im bulletproof
but im not
you took a swing
i took it hard
and down here from the ground i see who you are
im sick and tired of your attitude
im feeling like i dont know you
you tell me that you love me then you cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
that makes me run for cover when youre around
and heres to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what youre doing to me
tell me why
you could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day
well i get so confused and frustrated
forget what im trying to say oh
im sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me then push me around
heres to you and your temper
why do you have to make me feel small
so you can feel whole inside
why do you have to put down my dreams
so youre the only thing on my mind
you tell me that you want me then cut me down
ive got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love then you push me around
tell me why why
i take a step back let you go
i told you im not bulletproof
now you know
all this time i was wasting hoping you would come around
ive been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
and its taken me this long baby but ive figured you out
and youre thinking well be fine again but not this time around
you dont have to call anymore
i wont pick up the phone
this is the last straw
dont wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that youre sorry
but i dont believe you baby like i did before
youre not sorry no no no no
youre looking so innocent
i might believe you if i didnt know
couldve loved you all my life if you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
and youve got your share of secrets
and im tired of being last to know
and now youre asking me to listen cause its worked each time before but
you had me crawling for you honey and it never would have gone away
you used to shine so bright but i watched all of it fade so
theres nothing left to beg for
no no no
he is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear and its like
i couldnt ask for anything better
he opens up my door and i get into his car
and he says you look beautiful tonight
and i feel perfectly fine
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and its am and im cursing your name
youre so in love that you act insane
and thats the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
its a roller coaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
hes close to my mother
talks business with my father
hes charming and endearing
and im comfortable
he cant see the smile im faking
and my hearts not breaking
cause im not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating intoxicating
complicated got away by some mistake and now
i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
its am and im cursing your name
im so in love that i acted insane
and thats the way i loved you oh oh
never knew i could feel that much
once upon a time
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
were you just kidding
cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
i dont feel welcome anymore
baby what happened please tell me
cause one second it was perfect now youre halfway out the door
and i stare at the phone he still hasnt called
and then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
cause i was there when you said forever and always
was i out of line
did i say something way too honest made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute now im not so sure
so heres to everything coming down to nothing
heres to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going
thought i knew for a minute but i dont anymore
you didnt mean it baby i dont think so
oh back up baby back up
did you forget everything
back up baby back up
cause it rains in your bedroom
oh i stare at the phone he still hasnt called
and you flashback to when we said forever and always
and it rains in your bedroom
you didnt mean it baby you said forever and always yeah
im five years old its getting cold ive got my big coat on
i hear your laugh and look up smiling at you i run and run
past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
look now the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
i dont know why all the trees change in the fall
but i know youre not scared of anything at all
dont know if snow whites house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day with you today
im thirteen now
and dont know how my friends could be so mean
i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
and we talk and window shop til ive forgotten all their names
i dont know who im going to talk to now at school
but i know im laughing on the car ride home with you
dont know how long its going to take to feel okay
i have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother inside and out
hes better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you
there is a video i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me
its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
and daddys smart
and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
and now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
for staying back and watching me shine
and i didnt know if you knew so im taking this chance to say
that i had the best day with you today
and its a sad picture the final blow hits you
somebody else gets what you wanted again and
you know its all the same another time and place
repeating history and youre getting sick of it
but i believe in whatever you do
and ill do anything to see it through
because these things will change
can you feel it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution the time will come
for us to finally win
and well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
so weve been outnumbered raided and now cornered
its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
were getting stronger now finding things they never found
they might be bigger but were faster and never scared
you can walk away say we dont need this
but theres something in your eyes says we can beat this
cause these things will change
tonight we stand get off our knees
fight for what weve worked for all these years
and the battle was long its the fight of our lives
but well stand up champions tonight
it was the night things changed
can you see it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
its a revolution throw your hands up
cause we never gave in
and well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
you were in college working parttime waiting tables
left a small town and never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of falling
wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
i say can you believe it
as were lying on the couch
the moment i could see it
yes yes i can see it now
do you remember we were sitting there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
you are the best thing thats ever been mine
flash forward and were taking on the world together
and theres a drawer of my things at your place
you learn my secrets and figure out why im guarded
you say well never make my parents mistakes
but we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
yes yes
this is what i thought about
do you remember all the city lights on the water
you saw me start to believe for the first time
and i remember that fight am
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the goodbye
cause thats all ive ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said ill never leave you alone
you said i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you its like the first time
i fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
she is the best thing thats ever been mine
hold on make it last
hold on never turn back
yeah yeah
do you believe it
were gonna make it now
and i can see it
i can see it now see it now
the way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and im a house of cards
youre the kind of reckless
that should send me running
but i kinda know that i wont get far
and you stood there in front of me
just close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldnt see
what i was thinking of
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
my mind forgets to remind me
youre a bad idea
you touch me once and its really something
you find im even better than you imagined i would be
im on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you i know its no good
and i could wait patiently but i really wish you would
i run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keeping your eyes on me its just wrong enough to make it feel right
and lead me up the staircase
wont you whisper soft and slow
im captivated by you baby like a firework show
and the sparks fly
oh baby smile
im so glad you made time to see me
hows life tell me hows your family
i havent seen them in a while
youve been good busier than ever
we small talk work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why
cause the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying im sorry for that night
and id go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
wishing id realized what i had when you were mine
id go back to december turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time
these days i havent been sleeping
staying up playing back myself leaving
when your birthday passed and i didnt call
and i think about summer all the beautiful times
i watched you laughing from the passenger side and
realized i loved you in the fall
and then the cold came
the dark days when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye
id go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i miss your tan skin your sweet smile so good to me so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again i swear id love you right
id go back in time and change it but i cant
so if the chain is on your door i understand
but this is me swallowing my pride
and id go back to december
all the time
i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in
on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
i sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family
all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
this is surely not
what you thought it would be
i lose myself in a daydream
where i stand and say
dont say yes run away now
ill meet you when youre out
of the church at the back door
dont wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
fond gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play
a song that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that i was uninvited
by your lovely bridetobe
she floats down the aisle
like a pageant queen
but i know you wish it was me
you wish it was me dont you
ooh ladadada oh
ooh ooh
say a single vow
i hear the preacher say
speak now or forever hold your peace
theres the silence theres my last chance
i stand up with shaking hands all eyes on me
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but im only looking at you
hehe
and you say
lets run away now
ill meet you when
im out of my tux at the back door
baby i didnt say my vows
so glad you were around when they said
speak now
long were the nights when
my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
praying the floor wont fall through again
my mother accused me of losing my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky
then go back and turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules everyday
wonderin which version of you i might get on the phone tonight
well i stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why
dear john i see it all now that youre gone
dont you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i shoulda known
well maybe its me
and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe its you and your sick need
to give love and take it away
and youll add my name to your long list of traitors
who dont understand
and i look back in regret how i ignored when they said
run as fast as you can
dear john i see it all now it was wrong
dont you think nineteens too young
to be played by your dark twisted games
when i loved you so
you are an expert at sorry
and keeping the lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes
cause you burned them out
but i took your matches
before fire could catch me
so dont look now
im shining like fireworks
over your sad empty town yeah
oh oh oh oh oh oh
i see it all now that youre gone
the girl in the dress
wrote you a song you shoulda known
you shoulda known
dont you think i was too young
you with your words like knives
and swords and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again
got me feeling like im nothing
you with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when im wounded
you picking on the weaker man
but you can take me down with just one single blow
but you dont know what you dont know
someday ill be living in a big old city
and all youre ever gonna be is mean
someday ill be big enough so you cant hit me
why you gotta be so mean
you with your switching sides
and your wildfire lies and your humiliation
you have pointed out my flaws again
as if i dont already see them
i walk with my head down trying to block you out
cause ill never impress you
i just want to feel okay again
i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
cause you cant lead me down that road
and you dont know what you dont know
and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big loud opinion
but nobodys listening
washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
drunk and grumbling on about how i cant sing
but all you are is mean
all you are is mean
and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
and mean and mean and mean and mean
but someday ill be living in a big old city
and all youre ever going to be is mean yeah
and all youre ever going to be is mean
i used to think one day wed tell the story of us
how we met
and the sparks flew instantly
and people would say theyre the lucky ones
i used to know my place was a spot next to you
now im searching the room for an empty seat
cause lately i dont even know what page youre on
oh a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fallout
so many things that i wish you knew
so many walls up that i cant break through
now im standing alone in a crowded room
and were not speaking
and im dying to know
is it killing you like its killing me
yeah i dont know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
next chapter
howd we end up this way
see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
and youre doing your best to avoid me
im starting to think one day ill tell the story of us
of how i was losing my mind when i saw you here
but you held your pride like you should have held me
oh im scared to see the ending
why are we pretending this is nothing
id tell you i miss you but i dont know how
ive never heard silence quite this loud
yeah and i dont know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down
this is looking like a contest
of who can act like they care less
but i liked it better when you were on my side
the battles in your hands now
but i would lay my armor down
if you say youd rather love than fight
so many things that you wish i knew
but the story of us might be ending soon
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now now now
and im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me
and i dont know what to say since a twist of fate because were going down
the end
your little hands wrapped around my finger
and its so quiet in the world tonight
your little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming
so i tuck you in turn on your favorite night light
to you everythings funny you got nothing to regret
id give all i have honey
if you could stay like that
oh darling dont you ever grow up
dont you ever grow up just stay this little
dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
i wont let nobody hurt you wont let no one break your heart
and no one will desert you
just try to never grow up never grow up
youre in the car on the way to the movies
and youre mortified your moms dropping you off
at theres just so much you cant do
and you cant wait to move out someday and call your own shots
but dont make her drop you off around the block
remember that shes getting older too
and dont lose the way that you dance around in your pjs getting ready for school
no ones ever burned you nothings ever left you scarred
and even though you want to just try to never grow up
take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
remember the footsteps remember the words said
and all your little brothers favorite songs
i just realized everything i have is someday gonna be gone
so here i am in my new apartment
in a big city they just dropped me off
its so much colder that i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my night light on
wish id never grown up
i wish id never grown up
oh i dont wanna grow up wish id never grown up
i could still be little
it could still be simple
wont let nobody hurt you
wont let no one break your heart
and even though you want to please try to never grow up
oh dont you ever grow up
oh never grow up just never grow up
there i was again tonight
forcing laughter faking smiles
same old tired lonely place
walls of insincerity shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when i saw your face
all i can say is
it was enchanting to meet you
your eyes whispered have we met
across the room your silhouette
starts to make its way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
and it was
enchanting to meet you
i was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling
dont you let it go
im wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
ill spend forever
wondering if you knew
the lingering question kept me up
am who do you love
i wonder til im wide awake
and now im pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
id open up and you would say hey
it was
all i know is i was
enchanted to meet you
this night is flawless
dancing around all alone
this is me praying that
this was the very first page
not where the storyline ends
my thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back
as i was leaving too soon
please dont be in love
with someone else
please dont have somebody
waiting on you
now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
ha time for a little revenge
the story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
i had it all i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along got him alone and lets hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say sabotage
i never saw it coming wouldnt have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealing from
shes not a saint and shes not what you think
shes an actress whoa
shes better known for the things that she does
on the mattress whoa
soon shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
on the playground wont make you many friends
she should keep in mind she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge ha
she looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
she looks at me like im a trend and shes so over it
i think her everpresent frown is a little troubling
and she thinks im psycho cause i like to rhyme her name with things
but sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
oh they didnt teach you that in prep school so its up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
you might have him but havent you heard
you might have him but i always get the last word
whoa whoaahoh
do you still feel like you know what youre doing
cause i dont think you do oh
i dont think you do i dont think you do
lets hear the applause
come on show me how much better you are so much better yeah
see you deserve some applause
cause youre so much better
she took him faster than you could say sabotage
i guess you really did it this time
left yourself in your warpath
lost your balance on a tightrope
lost your mind trying to get it back
wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days
always a bigger bed to crawl into
wasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything
and everybody believed in you
its alright just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh who you are is not where youve been
youre still an innocent
did some things you cant speak of
but at night you live it all again
you wouldnt be shattered on the floor now
if only you had seen what you know now then
wasnt it easier in your fireflycatching days
when everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
wasnt it beautiful running wild til you fell asleep
before the monsters caught up to you
ohwho you are is not where youve been
its okay life is a tough crowd
and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
time turns flames to embers
youll have new septembers
every one of us has messed up too
lives change like the weather
i hope you remember
today is never too late to be brand new
its never too late to get it back
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
but i never thought id live to see it break
its getting dark and its all too quiet
and i cant trust anything now
and its coming over you like its all a big mistake
whoa holding my breath
wont lose you again
somethings made your eyes go cold
cmon cmon dont leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
somethings gone terribly wrong
youre all i wanted
cant breathe whenever youre gone
cant turn back now im haunted
stood there and watched you walk away
from everything we had
but i still mean every word i said to you
he will try to take away my pain
and he just might make me smile
but the whole time im wishing it was you instead
oh holding my breath
wont see you again
something keeps me holding onto nothing
i just know
youre not gone you cant be gone no
wont finish what you started
never ever thought id see it break
never thought id see it
i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at
the words that you whispered
for just us to know
you told me you loved me
so why did you go away
away
i do recall now the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement
i ran off the plane
that july th
the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt
i can still feel your arms
but now ill go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i dont know how to be something you miss
i never thought wed have a last kiss
never imagined wed end like this
your name forever the name on my lips
i do remember the swing of your step
the life of the party youre showing off again
and i roll my eyes and then
you pull me in
im not much for dancing
but for you i did
because i love your handshake meeting my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you kissed me when i was in the middle of saying something
theres not a day i dont miss those rude interruptions
so ill watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe
and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope its nice where you are
and i hope the sun shines
and its a beautiful day
and something reminds you
you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind
so ill go sit on the floor
just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
just like our last
i said remember this moment in the back of my mind
the time we stood with our shaking hands
the crowds in the stands went wild
we were the kings and the queens
and they read off our names
the night you danced like you knew our lives
would never be the same
you held your head like a hero
on a history book page
it was the end of a decade
but the start of an age
long live the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
i said remember this feeling
i passed the pictures around
of all the years that we stood there
on the sidelines wishing for right now
we are the kings and the queens
you traded your baseball cap for a crown
when they gave us our trophies
and we held them up for our town
and the cynics were outraged
screaming this is absurd
cause for a moment a band of thieves
in ripped up jeans got to rule the world
im not afraid
long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
i was screaming long live that look on your face
hold on to spinning around
confetti falls to the ground
may these memories break our fall
will you take a moment
promise me this
that youll stand by me forever
but if god forbid fate should step in
and force us into a goodbye
if you have children some day
when they point to the pictures
please tell them my name
tell them how the crowds went wild
tell them how i hope they shine
i had the time of my life with you
long long live the walls we crashed through
singing long live all the mountains we moved
and long long live that look on your face
elevator buttons and morning air
strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs
if you were here wed laugh about their vacant stares
but right now my time is theirs
seems like theres always someone who disapproves
theyll judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
the jurys out but my choice is you
so dont you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high the waters rough
but this love is ours
you never know what people have up their sleeves
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
but i dont care cause right now youre mine
and youll say
dont you worry your pretty little mind
and its not theirs to speculate if its wrong
and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
and ill fight their doubt and give you faith
with this song for you
cause i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
cause my heart is yours
but they cant take whats ours
they cant take whats ours
last night i heard my own heart beating
sounded like footsteps on my stairs
six months gone and im still reaching
even though i know youre not there
i was playing back a thousand memories baby
thinkin bout everything weve been through
maybe ive been going back too much lately
when time stood still and i had you
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside till i came out
you could you could if you just said youre sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie youd be here by now
i know people change and these things happen
but i remember how it was back then
wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
cause nothing like this ever happened to them
now im pacing down the hall chasing down your street
flashback to the night when you said to me
nothings gonna change not for me and you
not before i knew how much i had to lose
if youre out there if youre somewhere if youre moving on
ive been waiting for you ever since youve been gone
i just want it back the way it was before
and i just want to see you back at my front door
and i say come back come back come back to me like
you would before you said its not that easy
before the fight before i locked you out
but i take it all back now
youd be here by now
its not the kind of ending you want to see now
baby what about the ending
oh i thought youd be here by now
thought youd be here by now
tall dark and superman
he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
to save the world or go to work
its the same thing to me
hes got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him
i hang on every word you say yay
and you smile and say how are you
i say just fine
i always forget to tell you i love you i love you forever
i watch superman fly away
youve got a busy day today
go save the world ill be around
come back ill be with you someday
ill be right here on the ground
when you come back down
tall dark and beautiful
hes complicated hes irrational
but i hope someday youll take me away and save the day yeah
something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin
hes not all bad like his reputation
and i cant hear one single word they say
and youll leave got places to be and ill be ok
i always forget to tell you i love you i loved you from the very first day
and i watch you fly around the world
and i hope you dont save some other girl
dont forget dont forget about me
im far away but i never let you go
im lovestruck and looking out the window
dont forget dont forget where ill be
right here wishing the flowers were from you
wishing the card was from you
wishing the call was from you
cause i loved you from the very first day
forever and ever here
i swear ill be with you someday
im walking fast through the traffic lights
busy streets and busy lives
and all we know is touch and go
we are alone with our changing minds
we fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
and i never saw you coming
and ill never be the same
you come around and the armor falls
pierce the room like a cannon ball
now all we know is dont let go
we are alone just you and me
up in your room and our slates are clean
just twin fire signs four blue eyes
so you were never a saint
and ive loved in shades of wrong
we learn to live with the pain
mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
these are the hands of fate
youre my achilles heel
this is the golden age of something good
and right and real
this is a worthwhile fight
loving him is like driving a new maserati
down a deadend street
faster than the wind passionate as sin
ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind
once youre already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn so bright
just before they lose it all
losing him was blue like id never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing
all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
and realizing theres no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you never found out
that love could be that strong
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself its time now gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
loving him was red
and thats why hes spinning round in my head
comes back to me burning red
his love was like driving a new maserati down a deadend street
put your lips close to mine
as long as they dont touch
out of focus eye to eye
till the gravitys too much
and ill do anything you say
if you say it with your hands
and id be smart to walk away
but youre quick sand
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
and i i i like it
i cant decide if its a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
and all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
forever going with the flow but youre friction
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i will follow you follow you home follow you follow you home
this hope is treacherous
this daydream is dangerous
and iii iii iii
iii iii iii
ill follow you follow you home follow you follow you home
and iii like it
once upon a time a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights you got me alone
you found me you found me you found me
i guess you didnt care and i guess i liked that
and when i fell hard you took a step back
without me without me without me
and hes long gone when hes next to me
and i realize the blame is on me
cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places id never been
till you put me down oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
now im lying on the cold hard ground
trouble trouble trouble
no apologies hell never see you cry
pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
youre drowning youre drowning
youre drowning
and i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
a new notch in your belt is all ill ever be
and now i see now i see
now i see
he was long gone when he met me
and i realize the joke is on me hey
and the saddest fear comes creeping in
that you never loved me
or her or anyone or anything yeah
i walked through the door with you the air was cold
but something bout it felt like home somehow and i
left my scarf there at your sisters house
and youve still got it in your drawer even now
oh your sweet disposition
and my wideeyed gaze
were singing in a car getting lost upstate
the autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days
and i know its long gone and that magics not here no more
and i might be okay but im not fine at all
cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red cause you were looking over at me
wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well
photo album on the counter
your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
and your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee ball team
you taught me about your past thinking your future was me
and i know its long gone and there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to
cause there we are again in the middle of the night
were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well yeah
and maybe we got lost in translation
maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
till you tore it all up
running scared i was there i remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
cause i remember it all all all too well
time wont fly its like im paralyzed by it
id like to be my old self again
but im still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah
because there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
it was rare i was there i remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
down the stairs you were there you remember it all
it feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
and make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh
it feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
to fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
were happy free confused and lonely at the same time
its miserable and magical oh yeah
tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines
its time uh uh
i dont know about you but im feeling
everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
you dont know about me but i bet you wanted to
everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like were

i was reminiscing just the other day
while having coffee all alone and lord it took me away
back to a firstglance feeling on new york time
back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
took off faster than a green light go
hey you skip the conversation when you already know
i left a note on the door with a joke wed made
and that was the first day
and darling it was good never looking down
and right there where we stood was holy ground
spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
we had this big wide city all to ourselves
we blocked the noise with the sound of i need you
and for the first time i had something to lose
and i guess we fell apart in the usual way
and the storys got dust on every page
but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd
cause darling it was good never looking down
and right there where we stood was holy ground
tonight im gonna dance for all that weve been through
but i dont wanna dance if im not dancing with you
tonight im gonna dance like you were in this room
but i dont wanna dance if im not dancing with you
it was good never looking down
and right there where we stood was holy ground
tonight im gonna dance for all that weve been through
but i dont wanna dance if im not dancing with you
tonight im gonna dance like you were in this room
but i dont wanna dance if im not dancing with you
long handwritten note deep in your pocket
words how little they mean when youre a little too late
i stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
good girls hopeful theyll be and long they will wait
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
in dreams i meet you in warm conversation
we both wake in lonely beds different cities
and time is taking its sweet time erasing you
and youve got your demons and darling they all look like me
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
distance timing breakdown fighting
silence the train runs off its tracks
kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen
hang up give up and for the life of us we cant get back
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
new to town with a made up name
in the angel city chasing fortune and fame
and the camera flashes make it look like a dream
you had it figured out since you were in school
everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
so overnight you look like a sixties queen
another name goes up in lights like diamonds in the sky
and theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
but can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
now its big black cars and riviera views
and your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
and your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
and they tell you that youre lucky
but youre so confused
cause you dont feel pretty you just feel used
and all the young things line up to take your place
another name goes up in lights
you wonder if youll make it out alive
and theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
but can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
it was a few years later i showed up here
and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
how you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
they say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
chose a rose garden over madison square
and it took some time but i understand it now
cause now my name is up in lights but i think you got it right
let me tell you now youre the lucky one
let me tell you now youre the lucky one
let me tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
and theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
and theyll tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
oh whoa oh oh

i said  oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like were made of starlight
like were made of starlight
i met bobby on the boardwalk summer of
picked me up late one night at the window
we were  and crazy running wild wild
cant remember what song it was playing when we walked in
the night we snuck into a yacht club party
pretending to be a duchess and a prince
and i said  oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like were made of starlight starlight
like were made of starlight starlight
he said  look at you worrying too much about things you cant change
youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way
he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
dont you see the starlight starlight
dont you dream impossible things
like  oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like were made of starlight starlight
like were made of starlight starlight
ooh ooh hes talking crazy
ooh ooh dancing with me
ooh ooh we could get married
have ten kids and teach em how to dream
oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like were made of starlight starlight
like were made of starlight starlight
like were made of starlight starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
like starlight starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
dont you see the starlight starlight
dont you dream impossible things
took a deep breath in the mirror
he didnt like it when i wore high heels
but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didnt get this song but i do i do
walked in expecting youd be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you dont know how nice that is but i do
and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
ive been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
you said you never met one girl who
had as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you dont know why im coming off a little shy
but i do
and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
ive been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
and we walked down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies
that your family watches every single christmas
and i want to talk about that
and for the first time whats past is past
cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
ive been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
you shouldve been there
shouldve burst through the door
with that baby im right here smile
and it wouldve felt like
a million little shining stars had just aligned
and i wouldve been so happy
christmas lights glisten
ive got my eye on the door
just waiting for you to walk in
but the time is ticking
people ask me how ive been
as i comb back through my memory
how you said youd be here
you said youd be here
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and theyre all laughing
as im looking around the room
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
and the hours pass by
now i just wanna be alone
but your close friends always seem to know
when theres something really wrong
so they follow me down the hall
and there in the bathroom
i try not to fall apart
and the sinking feeling starts
as i say hopelessly
he said hed be here
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and theyre all laughing
and asking me about you
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
what do you say
when tears are streaming down your face
in front of everyone you know
and what do you do when the one
who means the most to you
is the one who didnt show
you shouldve been here
and i wouldve been so happy
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and theyre all standing around me singing
happy birthday to you
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
ohohohohohohohohohohohoh
i knew
ohohohohohohohohohohohoh
you call me later
and said  im sorry i didnt make it
and i said  im sorry too
and that was the moment i knew
you said it in a simple way
am the second day
how strange that i dont know you at all
stumbled through the long goodbye
one last kiss then catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall
i told myself dont get attached
but in my mind i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you
and this is when the feeling sinks in
i dont wanna miss you like this
come back be here come back be here
i guess youre in new york today
i dont wanna need you this way
come back be here come back be here
the delicate beginning rush
the feeling you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can put this down
if i had known what id known now
i never would have played so nonchalant
taxi cabs and busy streets
that never bring you back to me
i cant help but wish you took me with you
and this is when the feeling sinks in
i dont wanna miss you like this
come back be here come back be here
i guess youre in london today
i dont wanna need you this way
come back be here come back be here
this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is falling for you and you are worlds away
new york be here
but youre in london and i break down
cause its not fair that youre not around
i dont wanna miss you like this
come back be here
come back be here
dont look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
dont look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
i dont even know her
but i feel a responsibility to do whats upstanding and right
its kinda like a code yeah
and youve been getting closer and closer
and crossing so many lines
and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
but honey i am no ones exception
this i have previously learned
so dont look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
dont look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
now youve got me alone and i say
dont look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
i just want to make sure
you understand perfectly youre the kind of man who makes me sad
while she waits up you chase down the newest thing
and take for granted what you have
and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
and yeah i might go with it
if i hadnt once been just like her
so dont look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
dont look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that

dont look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that

youre about to lose your girl
call a cab lose my number
lets consider this lesson learned
want to see you pick up your phone
and tell her youre coming home
dont look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
it would be a fine proposition
if i hadnt once been just like her
walking through a crowd the village is aglow
kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
everybody here wanted something more
searching for a sound we hadnt heard before
and it said

clear blue water high tides came and brought you in
and i could go on and on on and on
and i will
skies grew darker currents swept you out again
and you are just gone and gone gone and gone
in silent screams and wildest dreams
i never dreamed of this
this love is good this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
tossing turning struggle through the night with someone new
and i could go on and on on and on
lantern burning flickered in my mind for only you
but you were still gone gone gone
been losing grip sinking ships
you showed up just in time
this love is good this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
your kiss my cheek i watched you leave
your smile my ghost i fell to my knees
when youre young you just run
but you come back to what you need
this love is good this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
you stand with your hand on my waistline
its a scene and were out here in plain sight
i can hear them whisper as we pass by
its a bad sign bad sign
something happens when everybody finds out
see the vultures circling dark clouds
loves a fragile little flame
it could burn out it could burn out
cause they got the cages they got the boxes
and guns
they are the hunters we are the foxes
and we run
baby i know places we wont be found
and theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
cause i i know places we can hide
i know places i know places
lights flash and well run for the fences
let them say what they want we wont hear it
loose lips sink ships all the damn time
not this time
just grab my hand and dont ever drop it
my love
they are the hunters we are the foxes
and we run
baby i know places we wont be found
and theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
cause i i know places we can hide
i know places i know places
they are the hunters we are the foxes
and we run
just grab my hand and dont ever drop it
my love
baby i know places we wont be found
and theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
cause i i know places we can hide
i know places i know places
they take their shots were bulletproof
i know places
and you know for me its always you
i know places
in the dead of night your eyes so green
i know places
and i know for you its always me
i know places
the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
it was months and months of backandforth
youre still all over me like a winestained dress i cant wear anymore
hung my head as i lost the war
and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning thats when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
there was nothing left to do
when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
so i punched a hole in the roof
let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
the water filled my lungs i screamed so loud
but no one heard a thing
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning thats when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
i think i am finally clean
ten months sober i must admit
just because youre clean dont mean you dont miss it
ten months older i wont give in
now that im clean im never gonna risk it
the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning thats when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning thats when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you
and i think i am finally clean
flashing lights and we
took a wrong turn and we
fell down a rabbit hole
you held on tight to me
cause nothings as it seems and spinning out of control
didnt they tell us dont rush into things
didnt you flash your green eyes at me
havent you heard what becomes of curious minds
didnt it all seem new and exciting
i felt your arms twistin round me
i should have slept with one eye open at night
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever ey ey
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better ey ey
ey ey ey ey ey
in wonderland
ey ey ey ey ey
in wonderland

so we went on our way too in love to think straight
all alone or so it seemed
but there was strangers watching
and whispers turned to talking
and talking turned to screams oh
didnt they tell us dont rush into things
didnt you flash your green eyes at me
didnt you calm my fears with a cheshire cat smile
didnt it all feel new and exciting
i felt your arms twisting round me
its all fun and games till somebody loses their mind
but darlin
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever ey ey
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better ey ey

to make you feel like what we had
and in the end in wonderland
we both went mad
oh

we pretended it could last forever last forever ey ey
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it got lost in it

one look dark room meant just for you
time moved too fast you play it back
buttons on a coat lighthearted joke
no proof not much but you saw enough
small talk he drives coffee at midnight
the light reflects the chain on your neck
he says  look up  and your shoulders brush
no proof one touch you felt enough
you can hear it in the silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love
morning his place burnt toast sunday
you keep his shirt he keeps his word
and for once you let go of your fears and your ghosts
one step not much but it said enough
you kiss on side walks you fight and you talk
one night he wakes strange look on his face
pauses then says  youre my best friend
and you knew what it was he is in love
you can hear it in the silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out
you are in love true love
and so it goes
you two are dancing in the snowglobe round and round
and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
and you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
and why i spent my whole life trying to put it into words
cause you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you can see it with the lights out
you are in love true love

you can hear it in the silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out
you are in love true love

you can feel it on the way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out
you are in love true love

fly like a firework
i tried my best at taking flight i tried my best to be just like
the other boys in school
i tried my best to get it right
and died at every duel
this mountainside is suicide
this dream will never work
still the sign upon my headstone write
a champion of the world
i tried my best to stay alight
fly like a firework
i tried my best at taking flight
but my rocketship reversed
oh referee dont stop the fight
everyone can see im hurt
but ill stand before conquistadors
til im champion of the world
and when i sail
im sailing west
though i might fail knowing i might fail
but still i am hoping for the best
and in my dreams
onto my chest
shell pin the colours and say
i wandered the whole wide world but
baby youre the best
so im flying on my bicycle
heading upwards from the earth
i am jumping with no parachute
out into the universe
i have et on my bicycle
because giving up wont work
i am riding on my rocketship
and im champion of the world
say people go
this particular diamond was extra special
and though you might be gone
and the world may not know
still i see you celestial
like a lion you ran
a goddess you rolled
like an eagle you circle
in perfect purple
so how come things move on
how come cars dont slow oh they say people come
say people go
this particular diamond was extra special
and though you might be gone
and the world may not know
still i see you celestial
like a lion you ran
a goddess you rolled
like an eagle you circle
in perfect purple
so how come things move on
how come cars dont slow
when it feels like the end of my world

theres a light that you give me
when im in shadow
theres a feeling you give me an everglow
like brothers in blood
sisters who ride
and we swore on that night
wed be friends til we die
but the changing of winds
and the way waters flow
life is short as the falling of snow
and now im gonna miss you i know
but when im cold cold
in water rolled salt
i know that youre always with me
and the way you will show
and youre with me wherever i go
and you give me this feeling
this everglow
oh what i would give for just a moment to hold
yeah i live for this feeling its everglow
so if you love someone
you should let them know
oh the light that you left me will everglow
i havent slept

and so my mouth waters to be fed
and youre always in my head

this i guess
is to tell you youre chosen out from the rest
from the rooftops i remember
there was snow
white snow
clearly i remember
from the windows they were watching
while we froze down below
when the futures architectured
by a carnival of idiots on show
youd better lie low
if you love me
wont you let me know was a long and dark december
from the rooftops i remember
there was snow
white snow
clearly i remember
from the windows they were watching
while we froze down below
when the futures architectured
by a carnival of idiots on show
youd better lie low
if you love me
wont you let me know
was a long and dark december
when the banks became cathedrals
and the fog
became god
priests clutched onto bibles
hollowed out to fit their rifles
and the cross was held aloft
bury me in armor
when im dead and hit the ground
my nerves are poles that unfroze
and if you love me
wont you let me know
i dont want to be a soldier
who the captain of some sinking ship
would stow
far below
so if you love me
whyd you let me go
i took my love down to violet hill
there we sat in snow
all that time she was silent still
so if you love me
wont you let me know
if you love me
wont you let me know
i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemys eyes
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead long live the king
one minute i held the key i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemys eyes
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead long live the king
one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells a ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i cant explain
once you go there was never
never an honest word
and that was when i ruled the world
it was the wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldnt believe what id become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh who would ever want to be king
i hear jerusalem bells a ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i cant explain
i know saint peter wont call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
i hear jerusalem bells a ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i cant explain
i know saint peter wont call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
two raindrops in the same sea
you could be me i could be you
two angles of the same view
and we share the same blood
comme deux gouttes deau
on se ressemble
comme provenant de la mme mre
comme deux ruisseaux you could be me
qui se rassemblent i could be you i could be you you could be me
two raindrops in the same sea
you could be me i could be you
two angles of the same view
and we share the same blood
comme deux gouttes deau
on se ressemble
comme provenant de la mme mre
comme deux ruisseaux you could be me
qui se rassemblent i could be you
pour faire les grandes rivires
and we share the same blood
yeah we share the same blood
and we share the same blood
yeah we share the same blood
music is the weapon music is the weapon of the future
music is the weapon music is the weapon of the future
music is the weapon music is the weapon of the future
same fucking blood
same fucking blood

its the end of death and doubt
and loneliness is out
coloratura
the place we dreamed about
the melodies inside yourself
and love come pouring out
and everyones allowed
were feathered by the crowd
and up there in the heavens coloratura
we fell in through the clouds
and everyone before us is there welcoming us now
its the end of death and doubt
and loneliness is out
coloratura
the place we dreamed about
the melodies inside yourself
and love come pouring out
and everyones allowed
were feathered by the crowd
and up there in the heavens

through pioneer and helix
oumamama heliopause and neptune
were a slow burning tune
but well get there

i just want you
in the end its all about
the love youre sending out
and up there in the heavens
the explorers whove all gathered by balloon
saw the world turn
through voyager callisto calliope
betelgeuse the neon moons
were a slow burning tune
but well touch down soon
so will you
and in this crazy world i do
i just want you
and up there in the heavens

every chance that you get
is a chance you seize
how long am i gonna stand
with my head stuck under the sand

before i see things the right way up
all that noise and all that sound
all those places i got found
and birds go flying at the speed of sound
to show you how it all began
birds came flying from the underground
if you could see it then youd understand
ideas that youll never find
all the inventors could never design
the buildings that you put up
japan and china all lit up
the sign that i couldnt read
or a light that i couldnt see
some things you have to believe
but others are puzzles puzzling me
all that noise and all that sound
all those places i got found
and birds go flying at the speed of sound
to show you how it all began
birds came flying from the underground
if you could see it then youd understand
ah when you see it then youll understand
all those signs i knew what they meant
some things you can invent
and some get made and some get sent

really know me
you have opinions
about my opinions
about my music
about my clothes
about my body
some people hate what i wear
some people praise it
some people use it to shame others
some people use it to shame me
but i feel you watching
always
and nothing i do goes unseen do you know me
really know me
you have opinions
about my opinions
about my music
about my clothes
about my body
some people hate what i wear
some people praise it
some people use it to shame others
some people use it to shame me
but i feel you watching
always
and nothing i do goes unseen
so while i feel your stares
your disapproval
or your sigh of relief
if i lived by them
id never be able to move
would you like me to be smaller weaker softer taller
would you like me to be quiet
do my shoulders provoke you
does my chest
am i my stomach my hips
the body i was born with
is it not what you wanted
if i wear what is comfortable
i am not a woman
if i shed the layers
im a slut
though youve never seen my body
you still judge it
and judge me for it
why
we make assumptions about people
based on their size
we decide who they are
we decide what theyre worth
if i wear more
if i wear less
who decides what that makes me
what that means
is my value based only on your perception
or is your opinion of me
not my responsibility
and i dont want to want you
but in my dreams i seem to be more honest
and i must admit youve been in quite a few
halleys comet

i wish someone had told me id be doing this by myself
theres reasons that im thankful theres a lot im grateful for
but its different when a strangers always waiting at your door
which is ironic cause the strangers seem to want me more im getting older i think im aging well
i wish someone had told me id be doing this by myself
theres reasons that im thankful theres a lot im grateful for
but its different when a strangers always waiting at your door
which is ironic cause the strangers seem to want me more
than anyone before anyone before
too bad theyre usually deranged
last week i realized i crave pity
when i retell a story i make everything sound worse
cant shake the feeling that im just bad at healing
and maybe thats the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
which is ironic because when i wasnt honest i was still being ignored
lying for attention just to get neglection
now were estranged
things i once enjoyed ahah
just keep me employed now
things im longing for
someday ill be bored of
its so weird
that we care so much until we dont
im getting older ive got more on my shoulders
but im getting better at admitting when im wrong
im happier than ever at least thats my endeavor
to keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
cause to be honest i just wish that what i promise
would depend on what im given not on his permission
wasnt my decision to be abused mmm
things i once enjoyed
just keep me employed now
things im longing for mmh
someday ill be bored of
its so weird
that we care so much until we dont
but next week i hope im somewhere laughing
for anybody asking i promise ill be fine

when you when you said you were passing through
was i even on your way
i knew when i asked you to when i asked you to
be cool about what i was telling you
youd do the opposite of what you said youd do what you said youd do
and id end up more afraid

you call me again drunk in your benz
driving home under the influence
you scared me to death but im wasting my breath
cause you only listen to your fucking friends
i dont relate to you
i dont relate to you no
cause id never treat me this shitty
you made me hate this city
and i dont talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
cause that shits embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me fucking sad
so dont waste the time i dont have
and dont try to make me feel bad
i could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but id have an empty line cause you never did
never paid any mind to my mother or friends
so i shut em all out for you cause i was a kid
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fucking leave me alone
just like you did before the accident
when youre staring into space
its hard to believe you dont remember it
woke up in the ambulance
you pieced it all together on the drive
i know you dont remember calling me
but i told you even then you looked so pretty
in a hospital bed sometimes you look the same
just like you did before the accident
when youre staring into space
its hard to believe you dont remember it
woke up in the ambulance
you pieced it all together on the drive
i know you dont remember calling me
but i told you even then you looked so pretty
in a hospital bed
i remember you said you were scared
and so was i
in a standstill on the five thought it was unusually early traffic
usually i dont panic i just wanted to be on time
when i saw the ambulances on the shoulder i didnt even think of pulling over
i pieced it all together late that night
and i know you dont remember calling me
but i told you even then you looked so pretty
in a hospital bed
i remember you said you were scared
and so was i
what if it happened to you on a different day
on a bridge where there wasnt a rail in the way
or a neighborhood street where the little kids play
or the angeles crest in the snow or the rain
what if you werent alone there were kids in the car
what if you were remote no one knows where you are
if you changed anything would you not have survived
youre alive youre alive youre alive
and i know you dont remember calling me
but i told you even then you looked so pretty
in your hospital bed
i remember you said you were scared
and so am i
i just wanna watch tv
ill stay in the pool and drown
so i dont have to watch you leave
i put on survivor just to watch somebody suffer
maybe i should get some sleep
sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
whats the point of anything
all of my friends are missing again i dont wanna talk right now
i just wanna watch tv
ill stay in the pool and drown
so i dont have to watch you leave
i put on survivor just to watch somebody suffer
maybe i should get some sleep
sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
whats the point of anything
all of my friends are missing again
thats what happens when you fall in love
you dont have the time you leave them all behind
you tell yourself its fine youre just in love
dont know where you are right now
did you see me on tv
ill try not to starve myself
just because youre mad at me
and ill be in denial for at least a little while
what about the plans we made
the internets gone wild watching movie stars on trial
while theyre overturning roe v wade
now all of my friends are missing again
cause thats what happens when you fall in love
you dont have the time you leave them all behind
and you tell yourself its fine youre just in love
and i dont get along with anyone
maybe im the problem

and id already lost what i was afraid to lose
now im in love without you
please dont still love me
im in love without you
but you still find a way inside my dreams
now can you see why you should get over me
soon there will be someone else for you to learn to need

of who i was and what we were and when we knew
you loved me less and less as you lean in against his chest
and hear the heartbeat that only beats for you
now im in love without you
so please dont still love me

she said you always had a way with people
a way of letting them leave
my hands could be the church to your fingers steeple
but you talk so mean
she said you know i love you
i said remind me
life moves on the way life does
but some things are prettier the way life was she said you always had a way with people
a way of letting them leave
my hands could be the church to your fingers steeple
but you talk so mean
she said you know i love you
i said remind me
life moves on the way life does
but some things are prettier the way life was
before we gave each other love gave each other love
life moves on the way life does
but some things are prettier the way life was
before we gave each other love love and broken arms
her silhouette glowed so familiar through
that bloodred curtain
i stood with strangers gazing
at the girl that i once knew
but ive grown uncertain
she said its just a bad dream
but she looked too happy
life moves on the way life does
but some things are prettier the way life was
before we gave each other love gave each other love
life moves on the way life does
but some things are prettier the way life was
before we gave each other love love
life moves on the way life does
but some things are prettier the way life was
before we gave each other love love
life moves on the way life does
but some things are prettier the way life was
before we gave each other up
changing the lock on every door
we only talk when its a bad time
nothing is fair in love or war
dont you look beautiful crying crying
isnt it comical trying trying
to keep it together when were not
selling the words we both forgot
bridges are burning as we walk away away taking a walk across the landmine
changing the lock on every door
we only talk when its a bad time
nothing is fair in love or war
dont you look beautiful crying crying
isnt it comical trying trying
to keep it together when were not
selling the words we both forgot
bridges are burning as we walk away away
tryna remember what you lost
what it was worth and what it cost
bridges are burning as we walk away away away
taking a drive along the train tracks
stayin alive turned up too loud
youll only survive me if you stay back
keeping my head inside the clouds
dont i sound terrible saying saying
were incompatible
why are you staying
why are you staying
tryna keep it together when were not
selling the words we both forgot
bridges are burning as we walk away away
tryna remember what you lost
what it was worth and what it cost
bridges are burning as we walk away away away
taking a walk across the landmine
changing the lock on every door
bury me in hollywood forever
underneath the starry sky
marry me in hollywood forever
dont pretend youll never die
like movie stars
in flashy cars
we talk like we know all the answers
leatherette

i said you look pretty
all strung out on coke
you said its not funny
but it wasnt a joke
and you wont remember
but i carried you home
you sat in the shower
while i washed off your clothes
but isnt that what friends are for
even if we used to be more
like lovers or partners in crime
when you were still mine i said you look pretty
all strung out on coke
you said its not funny
but it wasnt a joke
and you wont remember
but i carried you home
you sat in the shower
while i washed off your clothes
but isnt that what friends are for
even if we used to be more
like lovers or partners in crime
when you were still mine
you said we should get out
while we still could
and i should have listened
but i misunderstood
thought you wanted me tied down
it started to chafe
but its easy to see now
you just wanted me safe
and when the cops broke down our door
and held us both against our floor
did we look like lovers or partners in crime
did you look like mine
or did we look like fools
tryna get away with it all
thinkin wed be saved by a call
from each other
we were on the same boat
didnt see you for ages
didnt pick up your phone
made it out of our cages
never made it back home
i was late to the party
of an old family friend
i was lookin for parking
thought i saw you again
someone ive seen before
you couldnt look any more
like a lover or a partner in crime
or something of mine
i said you look pretty
all strung out on coke
you said its not funny
but it wasnt a joke
i swear i dont
miss you at all
and i barely still remember
whos in the pictures on my wall
cause no i cant
recall your scent
jasmine tuberose and lily
or your silly french accent
all but forgotten
about those eyes
the shade of green that if hed seen
would make f scott fitzgerald cry
but i wont i swear i dont
miss you at all
and i barely still remember
whos in the pictures on my wall
cause no i cant
recall your scent
jasmine tuberose and lily
or your silly french accent
all but forgotten
about those eyes
the shade of green that if hed seen
would make f scott fitzgerald cry
but i wont
break down at  am and call
cause i dont
miss you at all
and im sleeping fine
i dont mean to boast
but i only dream about you
once or twice a night at most
and it feels so good
eating alone
i dont get distracted by your smile
and miss the green lights driving home
no sign of stopping
the house isnt far
but i think our song is coming on
and now i wanna crash the car
but i wont
make that mistake again and fall
so i say i dont
miss you at all
and someday i wont
miss you at all
youre the sound of a song and i cant get you out of my head
youre the calm in the storm
youre the voice saying come back to bed
maybe im just too tired to keep runnin
maybe youre what i never saw comin
am i in your head
half as often as you on my mind
if i dont make sense youre the sound of a song and i cant get you out of my head
youre the calm in the storm
youre the voice saying come back to bed
maybe im just too tired to keep runnin
maybe youre what i never saw comin
am i in your head
half as often as you on my mind
if i dont make sense
please forgive me i cant sleep at night
at least not alone not anymore
not since i found what i never went looking for
and now youre in my head
i must have lost my mind
youre the scars on my skin
youre the past i dont wanna erase
youre the words on my lips that have left
but i still seem to taste
maybe im just too tired to keep lying
maybe youre all i ever wanted
am i in your head
half as often as you on my mind
if i dont make sense
please forgive me i cant sleep at night
at least not alone not anymore
not since i found what i never went looking for
and now youre in my head
i must have lost my mind
theres an empty space beside me
and ill keep it that way until youre here
i need you here
there was a different face beside me
but i sent her away
cause youre not here
here
am i in your head
half as often as you on my mind
if i dont make sense
please forgive me i cant sleep at night
at least not alone
theres no one else could ever hold me like you do
theres nowhere else that id rather be than with you
they call us lucky but i think we might be cursed
cause the way you love me
i could drink the river dry and still die of thirst
gimme gimme shelter from the storm
gimme gimme shelter keep me warm theres no one else could ever hold me like you do
theres nowhere else that id rather be than with you

nobody does it like you do you do you do you do
nothing beats being under you you do you do you do

marks on my back i wonder who you do you do you do
would understand what i go through you do you do you do
got your hands around my neck mama keep it in check
what do you want done to you
wanted freedom and got boredom
they wanted you to stay where you are
their game had no meaning
you found fame and it was fleeting
you became someone elses star
now all your memories feel more like films
you put em on to see which ones still kill couldnt beat em so you joined em
wanted freedom and got boredom
they wanted you to stay where you are
their game had no meaning
you found fame and it was fleeting
you became someone elses star
now all your memories feel more like films
you put em on to see which ones still kill
you wonder why the bad ones paid the bills
all the time
every night
you say another prayer theres a heaven
i say its anywhere youre forgiven
all the time
i think its time
took a drive with the whole family
that youve decided was so happy
but you were silent sitting in the backseat of the car
and time passes too slowly
then all at once youre so much older
making wishes on someone elses star
all the time
every night
you say another prayer theres a heaven
i say its anywhere youre forgiven
all the time
i think its time to let it go
youve gotta let it go
now all your second chances feel like thirds
you wonder what you wanted in the first
used to feel it all now it just hurts
all the time
every night
you say another prayer theres a heaven
i say its anywhere youre forgiven
all the time
its time
i think its time to let it go
like im watching a sequel ive already seen
i could tell you what happens to the new king
when he goes out of fashion
i want my money back nowow
ive been in the wrong crowdowd
id never say it out loudoud
but ive hated every word that comes out of your mouth it feels a little medieval if you ask me
like im watching a sequel ive already seen
i could tell you what happens to the new king
when he goes out of fashion
i want my money back nowow
ive been in the wrong crowdowd
id never say it out loudoud
but ive hated every word that comes out of your mouth
what should we fight about this time

what does it matter if youre not fine
you shouldve kept that shit offline
it feels a little medieval if you ask me
like im watching a sequel ive already seen
i could tell you what happens to the new king
when he goes out of fashion
it feels a little medieval kissing the ring
in a gothic cathedral have you ever seen
what really happens to people like me
when we go out of fashion
theyre gonna tear you from your pedestal its almost inevitable
im not being cynical its so unoriginal
if you get political theyll make you a criminal
its all a bit biblical
dont put your camera down
you dont go to heaven in a crown
its not worth the money bringing me back from the dead
i never said it would be any fun
you never shouldve trusted anyone
theyll love you til they know youre done
and then its off with his head
it feels a little medieval if you ask me
like im watching a sequel ive already seen
i could tell you what happens to the new king
when he goes out of fashion
it feels a little medieval kissing the ring
in a gothic cathedral have you ever seen
what really happens to people like me
when we go out of fashion
lying to me
saying im with you wherever youll be
a jump cut to the bed
we used to share
before you had the baby
and i cut off my hair
whats a life without the consequences
whats a knife without the sharpened edges
did i cut the wrong wire today
did i set it on fire the way close up on your lips
lying to me
saying im with you wherever youll be
a jump cut to the bed
we used to share
before you had the baby
and i cut off my hair
whats a life without the consequences
whats a knife without the sharpened edges
did i cut the wrong wire today
did i set it on fire the way
scotland burned in
like i never learned to leave a war
i just keep coming back for more
for more
a wide shot of the aisle of a grocery store
pan down to the crooked wheel on the dirty white floor
maybe all ill ever be is the cameo here
a face the crowd might recognize
that comes home twice a year
and then i disappear
did i cut the wrong wire today
did i set it on fire the way
scotland burned in
like i never learned to leave a war
i just keep coming back for more
can we take a walk before you walk away
can we try to talk or will you call it fake
can we take a walk before you walk away
walk away
whats a life without the consequences
whats a knife without the sharpened edges
did i cut the wrong wire today
did i set it on fire the way
scotland burned in
like i never learned to leave a war
i just keep coming back for more
for more
sometimes i think about the s
i know that everyone romanticized it
but you could sign me up
for a world without the internet
hate how easy they can find me
just by looking up my moms address
i think about the s
when i was not a problem yet
all the time i shouldve been so happy i was here sometimes i think about the s
i know that everyone romanticized it
but you could sign me up
for a world without the internet
hate how easy they can find me
just by looking up my moms address
i think about the s
when i was not a problem yet
all the time i shouldve been so happy i was here
wasting it on worrying just made it disappear
now my head feels so heavy
im left holding up the levee
feels so foreign im already home
i think about the s
when the future was a testament
to something beautiful and shiny now
were only counting down the time thats left
with everything behind me
i wonder how much of it ill forget
i think about the s
when i think about what i regret
all the time i shouldve been so happy i was here
wasting it on worrying just made it disappear
now my head feels so heavy
im left holding up the levee
feels so foreign im already home
when your heart starts to harden
lay your guard down in your garden
same backyard but we are not home
sometimes i think about the
sometimes i think about the
ohohohohoh oh
all the time i shouldve been so happy i was here
wasting it on worrying just made it disappear
now my head feels so heavy
im left holding up the levee
feels so foreign im already home
when your heart starts to harden
lay your guard down in your garden
same backyard but we are not home
if youve done everything right
is it the love you have at hand
or the cash you kiss at night
how do you know
if it was worth it in the end
did every second really count
or were there some you shouldnt spend
on anything but anyone you love
was this the life that you were dreaming of how do you know
if youve done everything right
is it the love you have at hand
or the cash you kiss at night
how do you know
if it was worth it in the end
did every second really count
or were there some you shouldnt spend
on anything but anyone you love
was this the life that you were dreaming of
a movie night a yellow light
youre slowing down and days are adding up
so dont waste the time you have waiting for time to pass
its only a lifetime
thats only a while
its not worth the anger you felt as a child
dont waste the time you have waiting for time to pass
its only a lifetime
thats not long enough
youre not gonna like it without any love
so dont waste it
im unimpressed
by the people preaching pain
for the sake of some small gain
in the sake of someones name
im unprepared
for my loved ones to be gone
call em way too often now
worry way too much about mom
dont waste the time you have waiting for time to pass
its only a lifetime
thats only a while
its not worth the anger you felt as a child
dont waste the time you have waiting for time to pass
its only a lifetime
thats not long enough
youre not gonna like it without any love
so dont waste it
its family and friends and thats the truth
the fountain doesnt give you back your youth
its staying up too late at night and laughing under kitchen lights
so hard you start to cry
dont waste the time you have waiting for time to pass
its only a lifetime
thats not long enough
youre not gonna like it without any love
so dont waste it

whatevers on the news the other sidell call it fake
i wish i was the queen id tell em all to eat their cake
maybe humankind was just gods mistake
how can you sing about love when the kids are all dying

now baby maybe were next

i think too much about myself
drink my wallet and drive my wealth
but enough about me
bang bang
knocking on my door
do you have a dollar would you like to fund a war
whats your carbon footprint and could you be doing more
i tried saving the world but then i got bored
and this fall theyre playing the hollywood bowl
ive already purchased two seats for their show
i guess im an optimist
you stole my heart here
and i couldnt listen to that band for years
til that night last summer when you reappeared
forgot how bad i wanted this your favorite band is back on the road
and this fall theyre playing the hollywood bowl
ive already purchased two seats for their show
i guess im an optimist
you stole my heart here
and i couldnt listen to that band for years
til that night last summer when you reappeared
forgot how bad i wanted this
if i could see the future
i never would believe her
fallin in and out of love and fallin in again
we were never any good at being friends
when harry met sally and you fell asleep
i closed your computer and stole the top sheet
i was strung out in austin for nearly a week
anxiety like we were kids
ive been thinkin too much and its ruined my nights
but its hard when it isnt to let yourself slide
and my heart doesnt slow down when you kill the lights
i never learned to call it quits
if i could see the future
i never would believe her
fallin in and out of love and fallin in again
we were never any good at being friends
ill go hungry and crazy and honest for you
i dont always get angry but im promisin to
if its all that you want then its all that i can do
desire i never made any sense
ill wait for years but i wont wait alone
and then someday youll wait for my face on your phone
and ill call and ill say i think you should come home
cause im tired of being your ex
can i take you out to a concert six months from now
you need to prove it somehow
its not dollar signs or pickup lines
or anything that you could kiss away now
that sinking feeling that you get
when you say something youll regret
cause you were jealous of some stranger
that she met when you were gone say its not enough to be in love
you need to prove it somehow
its not dollar signs or pickup lines
or anything that you could kiss away now
that sinking feeling that you get
when you say something youll regret
cause you were jealous of some stranger
that she met when you were gone
you feel insane cause love is pain
say its not okay to feel that way
its real you may not make her happy
so whats wrong with me if honestly
i wanna be the only way she can be
that hallow feeling in your chest
as you both wordlessly undress
after a fight its getting late
you tried your best but then she crid
and youre to blame and love is pain
dont believe anyone
who tells you any different
if its easy if its fun
somethings missing
theres this dream ive had bout mom and dad
makes me so sad i wake up crying
cant believe ill have to live through that
wish it wasnt mandatory dying
we go through life we play pretend
act like it doesnt have to end
its all alright until your friend runs a red light
you watch his car burst into flames
love is pain
i read an article on the internet
told me that thats how you know youre falling in love
dont really trust whats on the internet
but maybe just this once
hate to admit but it might be true
hate to admit but i think you knew
hate to be lame but i might love you its always on the tip of my tongue
i read an article on the internet

dont really trust whats on the internet
but maybe just this once
hate to admit but it might be true
hate to admit but i think you knew
hate to be lame but i might love you
its always on the tip of my tongue
but i stop myself from saying it
tell myself its not the right time or something dumb
but then you kiss me like you do
and were right back where we started from
hate to admit but it might be true
hate to admit but i think you knew
hate to be lame but i might love you
do i love him do i need him
do i want him do i care enough to say
that i love him that i need him
cause i dont but i wanna feel okay
if i love him if i need him
maybe that will make him stay
if i lie will i still feel this way
its always in the back of my mind
maybe my mistakes are the reason
that i made it back to you in time
if i could rewind
would there be some butterfly effect
what if we never met
what if the stars never aligned
hate to admit but it might be true
hate to admit but i think you knew
hate to be lame but i might love you
i hate it because i was a coward

I hear you callin', "Here I come baby"
To save you, oh oh
Baby no more stallin'
These hands have been longing to touch you baby
And now that you've come around, to seein' it my way
You won't regret it baby, and you surely won't forget it baby
It's unbelieveable how your body's calling for me
I can just hear it callin' callin' for me My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you Tell me, what's your desire
Baby your wish is my deal oh yes it is baby
Let me take you higher
Show you how you should feel, baby
Oh So we speak now and forever hold your body
Whatever it is you want from me, baby
You see you don't have to say nothing
Knowing your body wants something
And it's easy for me to see
That your body's callin' for me My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you I'm listening baby

I hear you callin' me
My body's callin' for you
I hear you callin' me
My body's callin' for you I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day (Night and day)
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly hoo See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho oh If I can see it hoo, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
Oh, I believe I can fly hoo Hey, 'cause I believe in me, oh If I can see it hoo, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it hey I believe I can fly hoo
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly) hey If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)

And together we will get through these times [Bridge:]
And we will cry together
And we'll fight this together
And we'll be strong together
Stand together, pray together [Chorus:]
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise, rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up Now I know the burdens that you've had
And you don't think nobody cares
A storm comes out of nowhere
And you're feeling like it just ain't fair
Not here to preach about the private side, no
'Cause I understand and now is not the time
See I just wanna help you make it right
Walk with you, holding the candle light [Bridge] [Chorus] You see struggle so hard

'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound
Somethings goin' on upstairs, yeah

Who would have thought she was creepin' with another man
The down low happened to me all over again And then I turned the TV down
'Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound
Somethin' goin' on upstairs, yeah

Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standin'
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be cryin'
Dead in the middle of a smile But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racin' for years
And still no finish line, oh But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free Somehow my beginning stepped right in (right in)
Then faith became my friend (my friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's sayin' (sayin') The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me) Won't you come and set me free
Won't you set me free The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free, yeah yeah
Won't you come and set me free, hey (It's like) It's like, I can see the light, shinin'!
Somewhere beyond the clouds
It's like, I can see the light, shinin'!
Take it down, down
Down on me, looks like, I can see the light, shinin'!
Fear is going, the world's turnin'
The clouds movin, the sun shinin'
(If that guy can see the light, shine it!)
The rain is gone, I made it home
Rainbow, pot of gold (The storm is over now)
I'm tellin' you I could see the light
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven over me, yeah
(Heaven is over me) Come and set me free
Come and set me free
Won't you come and set me free, yeah
(The storm is over now)
(Somewhere beyond the clouds) I am a mountain,
I am a tall tree, oh
I am a swift wind
Sweeping the country I am a river,
Down in the valley, oh
I am a vision
And I can see clearly If anybody asks you who I am, just stand up tall, look 'em in the face and say I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high

(Can you feel it?)Believe in a pot of gold
(He's the greatest)At the end of a rainbow How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you
(If I could turn back)
Forever honest and true to you
(If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you
(If I could turn back the hands) (If I could turn back)
That would be my will
(If I could turn back)
Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands

(If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
(If I could turn back the hands) (If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall

To every city

Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
Ghetto America! Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride (With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish Now ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride (With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men? And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride (With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Standing here throwing them songs at me
Somebody pray for me I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me

No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray [R Kelly]
And then you will see the morning will come
and everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see [Chorus: Celine Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your Angel,
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your Angel, I'm your Angel [R Kelly]
I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day [Celine Dion]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears just cast them on me
How can I make you see [Chorus] [R Kelly]
And when it's time to face the storm [Celine Dion]
I'll be right by your side [R Kelly]
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive [Celine Dion]

Saying "damn" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone 'Cause when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it) Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell, the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah (ooh, yeah)
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too, too many times
Now I can't come around 'Cause when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
Oh no, it's just like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it) Oh yeah, oh yeah, la la da da
La
La da da da da
La da da da da
La
Oh yeah, la da da da da
La
Oh, ah, listen, if you don't want to find out the hard way
Then listen to this song while the record plays When a woman's fed up
Mama taught me along time ago
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
Oh no, it's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
Then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it) Yeah
You can cry a river
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cookin' you ever had
Yes, it was and I miss her
Hey woman, if you're listening
Said I miss you baby, whoa, whoa, oh yeah When a woman loves
She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real She took me back
After I broke her heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl she raised me
And I'm forever indebted, and I'm forever indebted,
I'm forever indebted to her cause When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real She filled my soul
With the very touch of her hand
She really did
And she's got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand
And I like to tell her, I like to tell her, that I'm forever indebted,
That I'm forever indebted, forever indebted to her cause When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
Yea, yea See a woman love
It would never die young
Even when I'm dead and gone,
I'm gonna love her from the sky, yea

BARACK OBAMA:
In small towns and big cities
We came together
As democrats, republicans, and independents
To stand up and say that we are
ONE NATION, we are ONE PEOPLE
And our time for changed has COME.. R. KELLY:
When the mountain seems too high
And you don't have the courage nor the strength to climb
And the road you're on won't end
But still you run though you cannot see the finish line And dark clouds are over you
Your skies no longer blue
But you marched on straight ahead
Somehow you made it through Got to the mountain peek
They left a path of me
Your victory made history and now CHORUS:
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh I When it felt like you were weak
And couldn't fight no more
On the ropes and it seemed like
You was gonna run out of breathe When the world was on your shoulder
And the walls were in your way
You leaped and made it over
Through it all you kept the faith With hope you set us free
You showed us how to dream
And now we can lift our voices
And forever sing Now the time to look ahead
And thank our heroes of the past
And celebrate this victory
Let's raise the flag cause CHORUS:
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh I BRIDGE:
And when they tried to keep you down
You kept up your head
Never losing sight
You believed in what was right You endured to the end
Walked through the strongest wind
The storms over
And a new day begins And when our hope was dying
You brought us healing
And now I got something
To tell my children CHORUS:
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh I Baby you are the song of my life
And the sweetest melody
And I love making love to your eyes
It's like singing in the perfect key You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit I got a studio up in heaven
And it's the perfect atmosphere
It's guaranteed to make you platinum
All you gotta do is come here Let me make you my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit The way you put your music on me
Symphony should be your name
It's like God gave me the perfect echo
When he sent your love my way You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit New York to L.A. then press on to Rome
L.A. then Vegas then press our way home
Our music plays all around the world
And my life has been a smash since you became My number one hit As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to I look to you
I look to you After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong I look to you
I look to you Yeah And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song I look to you, you About to lose my breathe,
There's no more fighting left,
I'm sinking to rise no more,
Searching for that open door, door Every road that I've taken
Lead to my regret.
I don't know if I'm going to make it.
Nothing to do but lift my head I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you (Whitney)
We love you Whitney, rest in peace What's up baby?

In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise, she ain't you Now I've got this dumb look on my face
Like, what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?
Lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, "You can't go this way"
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, "Woman move out my way"
Said, "I got a wife at home"
She said, "Please don't go out there"
"Lady, I've got to get home"
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs "Shh, shh, quiet
Hurry up and get in the closet"
She said, "Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down"
I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"
"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"
"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet"
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home"
She says, "Honey, I'm in the room"
Walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', "Honey, I've been missin' you"
She hops all over him
And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar Throws her in the bed
And start to snatchin' her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it
But things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it"
And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet? He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, "Baby, come back to bed"
He says, "Bitch say no more"
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed
Then under the dresser
He looks at the closet
I pull out my Beretta
He walks up to the closet
He goes up to the closet
Now he's at the closet
Damn he's opening the closet? i need an angel i'm calling an angel send me an angel now Had the landlord at my door
I heard him saying,
Tomorrow no more
Pay me now or leave
But we didn't have anything to give(ah can you feel me) Searching for restoration(and we need restoration)
Make the church my family
This is my story
This is my song
And I can sing it all night long I tell you why because, [Chorus] The ghetto is a part of my religion(the only thing my eyes can see)
The only thing my eyes can see(and I tell you there ain't no man)
There ain't no man gonna stop the vision(I'm a part of the ghetto)
The ghetto is a part of me Children cry no more(children cry no more)
Because heaven is upon you
Please put down your guns
And we shall overcome Thought your load may be heavy
Know that the weight makes you strong
Take my life for example
While I sing my song
Mr. Kelly help me sing this song [Chorus X2] La la la la la lala la..X3 (fade out)
The ghetto is a part of me
The ghetto is a part of my religion [Celine Dion]
No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray [R Kelly]
And then you will see the morning will come
and everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see [Chorus: Celine Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your Angel,
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your Angel, I'm your Angel [R Kelly]
I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day [Celine Dion]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears just cast them on me
How can I make you see [Chorus] [R Kelly]
And when it's time to face the storm [Celine Dion]
I'll be right by your side [R Kelly]
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive [Celine Dion]
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near (end is drawing near)
Don't you dare give up the fight
Just put your trust beyond the skies [Chorus: Repeats] [Chorus]
This is my song for real no doubt
See the DJ is making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to dance floor
We begin to dance slow

Sprayed on these blocks
Moved in on these blocks
Went out on these blocks

Been watched on these blocks Yeah you know I walk
Through the valley of these blocks
I shall not fear these blocks
Because I run these blocks, yeah (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Paid my own dues with my own pennies
And I'm [Chorus] Now I believe the day will come
When my heart will decide to change
But until then
See everything will remain the same [Chorus] See sometimes I gotta tell myself

To keep surviving
And no matter what the cause

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up) Now usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to a hotel for just a one night stand
See, I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothin' like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child Tellin' myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seein' this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothin' like this, she's more than a mistress

And girl, well, it's about makin' love If you choose me I guarantee

Can we say a prayer together baby
Heavenly Father which art in heaven
I pray that you keep this love together
This is my prayer, baby, baby, baby, I love you I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then i look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before i knew it
Here comes this truck now Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years i've been straight You saved me [4x]
Gave me a second chance
You saved me [3x]
You saved me Now i've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said God's good
I just laugh at 'em But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and
That's when I knew You saved me [4x] Now i was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside i was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before i
Knew it I was on my knees Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do
I don't think i'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted Christ that day
Halilujah now i'm free You saved me [4x] I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so
I call my mama to calm my nerves (mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone You saved me [4x] You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooooooh You saved me You gave me it was by grace You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out
You saved me
You stepped in ooh save me You saved me Welcome to the quiet before the storm
No worries, love
Oh yeah, ain't no pressure

The love she's given me
Makes it easy to do a song like this
So this one's for you ma

We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams

Don't you know we love you sweet Sadie
Place no one above you sweet Sadie
Well well well (living in the past) Sometimes it seems so funny
No money can turn your life around
Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papas' old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry Sometimes she'd be so happy
Being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song Oh Sadie maiden
She's loving my song in a special way
Well, well, well
Sweet Sadie
Living in the past Oh she's never sinning
In love she's always winning yeah

How you gave me love, oh no

It's a mean world without you
And I surely miss you much mother And now that you're gone

'Cause your're cryin' lady, woah Sadie

Sometimes when I'm standin'
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be cryin'
Dead in the middle of a smile But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racin' for years
And still no finish line, oh But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free Somehow my beginning stepped right in (right in)
Then faith became my friend (my friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's sayin' (sayin') The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!) I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then i look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before i knew it
Here comes this truck now Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years i've been straight You saved me [4x]
Gave me a second chance
You saved me [3x]
You saved me Now i've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said God's good
I just laugh at 'em But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and
That's when I knew You saved me [4x] Now i was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside i was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before i
Knew it I was on my knees Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do
I don't think i'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted Christ that day
Halilujah now i'm free You saved me [4x] I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so
I call my mama to calm my nerves (mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone You saved me [4x] You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooooooh You saved me You gave me it was by grace You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out
You saved me
You stepped in ooh save me You saved me You remind me of something

Summertime and just talk about just making it
You know what I'm saying being successful
Following up our dreams you know and I
I believe that's every kids dream
You know what I'm saying to rise and
Be somebody but damn!
Sometimes we just get caught up I ain't got no money
And I ain't got no friends
Looks like my world is coming to an end
No food on the table, no clothes on my back
No shoes on my feet and
I just bearly got a used Cadillac
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah
Ghetto for ya
So I took this remix and
Rearranged gotham city [Chorus]
City of love a city of peace
For everyone of us
'Cause we all need it,
Can't live without it
Gotham city for the ghetto yeah! Gotham city for the ghetto,
That's what I'm talking 'bout
Ghetto fabulous, to a nigga health be hazardous
If you wanna test raffishness for the respect
S.T.R.I.N.G.S. Yes. (oh yeah)
Fuck the rest give me the best
Why should I have to settle for less
When I could push the V-12's with finesse
(scratching) and all that mess
If you try to hold me back
Would I keep on struggling till I hit the sky.
Even if you wanted to you can't deny
Gotta feed baby girl who would die We keep talking about escalating
Well who's gonna go first
Guess I'll be the one to step up
If you don't follow me it would be the worst
Every time something goes down
Somebody's crying ghetto tears
Hope I'm not raining on your parade
But this is not what keeping it really is
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah!
Ghetto for ya,
So I took this remix and rearranged
A gotham city [Chorus] Check it out
Now motherfucker wanna act surprised
'Cause you're afraid to change scared to rise
That's why you ass get left behind
They got a sight, they got a mind
'Cause ain't nobody gonna stop the dream

Negativity you gotta let go
Heaven gotta see for the ghetto We all need hey hey hey

Prayer changes things Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship
Knowing that, that was no way for me to live
A young girl like me, raised up in a good family
Way too young to endure such misery
And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
(He hit me) at any given time
(He hit me) no reason at all
(He hit me) so so hard
(He hit me) my God, sometimes I'd fall
Mama asked what happened to me
And I'd take up for him
She said that devil's a liar
And pray get rid of him
And now I'm going to school, hitting those books
I'm doing fine
He's out my life, I'm not confused
Got peace of mind, man I tell you Prayer changes (it changes)
Prayer changes (oh it changes)
Prayer changes (I'm a witness that)
Prayer changes things (said I know)
Prayer changes (it changes)
Prayer changes (it changes)
Prayer changes (I'm a living witness that)
Prayer changes things I was a freshman in college and uh
I had just made it on the basketball team
I had all the skills it took to make it
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's
And the coach came to me and had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was I brake down and cry 'cause
Everybody knows me, knows that basketball is my life
(Algebra) I studied hard
(Chemistry) I gave my all
(Calculus) oh my God
(English) so many flaws
Playing ball didn't look to good for me
My future, could not see
I had lost all my beliefs
And gave up on all my dreams
Then I went to church on Sunday
And the pastor began to preach
It was like he was talking to me
When he said I can do all things
In Christ that strengthens me
And for me that was enough
Now that I went from a D all the way to an A plus
I tell you prayer changes things Prayer changes
Prayer changes (prayer)
Prayer changes (it changes things)
Prayer changes things (oh)
Prayer changes (said it changes)
Prayer changes (things)

Prayer changes things Me and my wife had a few problems
We thought that nothing could solve them
Listening to family members and so called friends
Man I tell you that's just how the devil creeps in (oh yes it is)
We were separated at least for a month or two
She was wilding in the clubs
And I was out there doing wrong too
And we would walk around the house
Putting each other down
I mean right in front of the kids
We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident
And almost lost my life
And guess who was there for me
My wife
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way
When we said there was no way
I'm out the hospital and back at home
Planning another wedding day, I tell you Prayer changes (it changes)

Prayer changes things (things, I'm a witness that)
Prayer changes (change)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)
Prayer changes things Now all of these things were happening in one family
But that's okay, 'cause there's nothing God can't achieve
I don't care what the problem in your life may be
'Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed
And if you didn't know, now you should know
All you gotta do is take this family's life for example
Now Mom and Dad are married again
Four kids now, 'cause they just had twins
Little sister all grown up now
She's a lawyer, married with one child now
Two years, big brother's out of college
And man he's got his hands full (hallelujah)
Blessed with skills, blessed with knowledge
Now he's playing for the Chicago Bulls Prayer changes (I'm a witness yeah)

But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth (Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't want to let me live When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin'
'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the kid with his paper a pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo', we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memory
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors before careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine (Fo' real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(Fo' real tho') It hurts to know you want to see me fail
(Fo' real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(Fo' real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held They turn they backs on you, who was there believin'
Who said your troubles were only for a season
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it all out Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
(Please shower down)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me and lift me up (Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah) Man, I tell you it's enough to make you want to give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and to brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another
And stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what want to see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dining
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are high
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fight
Frankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired
Have dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is alive (Fo' real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(Fo' real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(Fo' real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(Fo' real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me And as for robbin', here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
Media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm still young tryin' to figure it all out Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me (Shower down on me now), wet me with your love
I need you to take me (Please) and lift me up, yeah,
Yeah (Said I'm callin' on heaven) Heaven, I need a hug

Like an eagle when it soars in the sky Out of all the girls I've loved before
Out of all the stages I've performed on
Out of all of the cities I've been to
I bless the day that I found you I bless the day I found you and that's my word
It's nothing for me out there in those streets
You took my heart and you set it on fire
And now my love forever burns
You keep taking me higher [Chorus]
I been looking for love
In all the wrong places
And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm
It was you who helped me face it
And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me Just like the wings
You took me, flew me away, yeah
And now my ground is underneath my feet
This man had nowhere to go
Then you gave me direction
And now the rest of my days
I can't help but give you the praise [Chorus] You saw my needs, forgave my faults
You cleansed my heart, you changed my thoughts
You brought the sun into my life
When my world had seemed dark, yes you did
And you're the only one
Who was there when I needed a friend
You're the only one who can place joy
When there's pain in my heart [Chorus] la la la la la la la la la Anticipate you grace to stage

Wait a minute, calm down
I was at the club with who?
Get the fuck...man, you know what Girl I'm not about to sit up here and argue with you about who's to blame
I call no names, real talk
See girl, only thing I'm trying to establish with you is not
Who's right or who's wrong, but what's right and what's wrong
Real talk
Just because your friend say she saw me at a club with some other bitches
Sitting in VIP, smoking and drinking and kicking it, tell me girl Did she say there were other guys there?
Did she say there were other guys there?
Were there other guys there?
Well, tell me this How the fuck she knew I was with them other girls then
When the whole club packed wait a minute let me finish what I've got to say
I've been with you five years and you listening to your motherfucking girlfriends
I don't know why you fuck with them all jealous no man havin' ass holes anyway
Real talk
Alway accusing me of some old bullshit when I'm just trying to have a good time
